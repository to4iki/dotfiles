# CLAUDE.md - Global Level

## Development Style

- Develop with TDD (Explore → Red → Green → Refactoring)
- Ask questions to clarify unclear instructions

## Code Design

- Maintain separation of concerns
- Separate state from logic
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Strictly define the contract layer (API/types) and keep the implementation layer regenerable
